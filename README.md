# 🎀 Pixel Dream Portfolio Website

A visually unique and accessible HTML/CSS-only portfolio website with a softcore gamer-girl aesthetic. Created as part of a front-end design exploration, the site combines pixel fonts, pastel gradients, GIFs, and 2000s web nostalgia to present a playful but thoughtfully structured user experience.

> 💡 No JavaScript. Just semantic HTML5 and clean CSS.
