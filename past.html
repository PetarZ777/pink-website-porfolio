                <h2>How I Started</h2> 
                <p>I was enrolled in Medical Science at USYD, not sure if I wanted to pursue it as i wanted to try coding. I had a data analytics class in which i got to learn R, and fell in love with probelm solving and coding.</p></br>
                <p>Now I am enrolled in Bachelors of Computing Science (Honours) at UTS. Although it is at times challenging, I still find myself enjoying the learning process within this course. And I hope I will continue to feel this way.</p>

                <h2>Past Experience</h2>
                <p>Prior to university I have had no experience in coding or any IT related topics.</p>
